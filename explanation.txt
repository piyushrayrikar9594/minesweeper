Entire game is just based on HTML & JAVASCRIPT only.
No other language is used for this game creation.
JavaScript supports three important types of dialog boxes i.e mostly used Alert for warning puposes,Confirmation for suggestion purpose & Prompt for user input. These dialog boxes can be used to raise and alert, or to get confirmation on any input or to have a kind of input from the users.
Here user name is catched by prompt dialog box and alert dialogue box gives the current event triggred in general.
JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.
In <body> tag of HTML, table is made with importance given to unique id attribute of <div> tag where changes would be reflected for every action like, to hover ,etc  by javascript sequentially.
Random numbers are generated using Math.random() which returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
While Math.floor() returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number.
	Consider, no=Math.floor(Math.random()*11)
	Math.random() always provides us number between 0 - 0.9 multiplyling this random number by 11, provides us a number between 0 - 10
Dividing these output numbers in half range(<7 & >6), we get set of positive(+) actions and negative(-) actions respectively.
Thus adding innovative style background like radial-gradient, sound effects adds more colors to this program inducing thrilling action.
